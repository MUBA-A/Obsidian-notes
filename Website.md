[[TO DO LIST (WEBSITE)]]:

## Problem: There are very few educational resources for Mongolians online. Is that even a problem? Can't people just use google translate for stuff? Isn't that more efficient since it would mean there are more things available via google translate?

## Solution/Objective: 

Generate quizzes with AI and up my prompt engineering game.

Problem that I have: 
1. I do not know whether there is a resource scarcity online for Mongolians. 
	+ If yes, I can make a website that has various educational/tutorial-type learning resources.
	+ If no, I can still make it but what would be the structure/purpose of my website?

2. I do not know anything about the ethics/morality around copyrights of content created by chatGPT.
